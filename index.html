	<p>When sitting down with Joselyn Mendoza, one cannot help but admire her seemingly effortless look. The caramel sheen of her hair has a subtle ombre highlighting, and her soulful eyes have been shadowed by two perfectly symmetrical sweeps of cobalt liner; precision like this would require a needlelike accuracy.</p>

	<p>It is not surprising to learn that Mendoza, who has been studying at the cosmetology Formula B Parisien School in Woodside, Queens, has been maintaining a 92 percent GPA since enrollment.
